Changelog for check_gpu_sensor, a Nagios/Icinga plugin to check GPU sensors
################################################################################

Version 2.4 20210702
  * New option --no-throttle-alarm to avoid receiving alarm in case of throttle 
    events. Throttle events could still be present in performance data in case 
    enabled. Default behavior not changed.

Version 2.3 20130610
  * The Switch module did not work with CentOS Perl 5.8.8, therefore now
    if/elsif statements are used.

Version 2.2 20130606
  * Removing config ini files as there is no native rpm package. Now a simple
    perl hash is used for threshold configuration.

Version 2.1 20130528
  * Using switch/case feature to be compatible with icinga embedded perl
    interpreter and perl versions < 5.10.

Version 2.0 20130422
  * Removed deprecated functions from old driver bindings
  * Enhanced error checking for NVML library
  * Renamed sensors to fit more to nvidia-smi names
  * Thresholds can be configured in an ini-style config
  * Added more features
    * PCIe link generation and width
    * Power Readings
    * Throttle Reasons
    * ECC Error checking
    * Persistence Mode checking
    * Inforom validation
  * Version 2 was tested on an Ubuntu 12.04.2 with NVIDIA driver version 304.48
    and NVML version 4304.48 and a Tesla K20 card.

Version 1.2 20120912
  * The return of check_perf_threshold was not checked correctly. Fixed the
    string of the return status.

Version 1.1 20120621
  * Switched to single GPU support as it is easy to define multiple
    check_gpu_sensor plugin calls with different device IDs/PCI bus strings.
  * A valid device ID or a PCI Bus ID is now required. The IDs specify the
    gpu device to query, the safest way is via the PCI Bus ID as it is not
    ensured that device IDs stay persistent across reboots. Get the IDs with 
    the nvidia-smi tool of the nvidia driver.

Version 1.0 20120516
  * The following features are implemented and tested successfully:
     * GPU temperature
     * GPU memory usage
     * GPU device fan speed
  * The following features are implemented BUT must be tested on suited hardware:
     * Support for multi GPU systems
     * GPU clock information
     * Output from ROM versions
     * ECC information
     * Power Management Mode
     * GPU Utilization Rates
  * The output of performance data is tested with Icinga 1.6.1 on Debian Lenny
    and Icinga 1.6.1 on Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS
  * Checking of a remote host via NRPE is tested with
     * Nagios NRPE Plugin 2.12.4 on the Icinga host (Debian Lenny)
     * Nagios NRPE Server 2.12-5 on an Ubuntu Remote host
  * Various information about the GPU can be displayed
     * Number of GPUs in the system
     * Product Name
     * Device PCI Information
  * Information about driver setup
     * NVIDIA driver version
     * NVML version
